## Overview

The Sign Language Translator aims to bridge communication gaps by converting sign language gestures into readable text. This project uses computer vision and machine learning techniques to recognize gestures and translate them into corresponding words.

## Machine Learning Architecture

The machine learning architecture used in this project is based on Support Vector Machines (SVM). The process includes:

1. **Data Collection**: Gathering a dataset of sign language gestures.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and formatting the data for model training.
3. **Model Training**: Using SVM to learn from the data.
4. **Prediction**: Applying the trained model to classify new gestures.

The SVM algorithm works by finding the optimal hyperplane that separates different classes in the dataset. It is effective in high-dimensional spaces and is used for both classification and regression tasks.

## What is SVM?

Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It works by identifying the hyperplane that best separates the classes in the feature space. Key features of SVM include:

- **Margin Maximization**: SVM maximizes the distance between the hyperplane and the nearest data points from each class (support vectors).
- **Kernel Trick**: SVM can use different kernel functions to handle non-linear data by transforming it into higher dimensions.
- **Robustness**: SVM is effective in high-dimensional spaces and is less prone to overfitting compared to other algorithms.

## How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MuhammedBasith/sign-language-translator-svm.git
   cd sign-language-translator-svm
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Make sure you have Python installed, then run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Main File**:
   Execute the main file to start the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. **Usage**:
   Follow the prompts in the terminal to input gestures or provide images for prediction.

## Conclusion

This Sign Language Translator demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to create an interactive tool for gesture recognition. Feel free to explore, modify, and enhance the project as needed.
